# Problem 1

A random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hw1_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = ifelse(samp > 0, TRUE, FALSE),
  vec_char = rep(c("New York", "Chicago", "Los Angeles"), length.out = 10),
  vec_factor = factor(rep(c("East Coast", "Midwest", "West Coast"), length.out = 10))
)

hw1_df

mean(hw1_df$samp)
mean(hw1_df$vec_logical)
mean(hw1_df$vec_char)
mean(hw1_df$vec_factor)
```

It appears we can take the mean of the random numbers and the logical vector but not the character vector or the factor vector.

# Problem 2

Plot
```{r}
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = 2*x
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```
